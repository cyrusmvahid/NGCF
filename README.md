## Introduction
Collaborative filtering is one of the oldest and most explored methods in recommendation. It created a connection between users, who interact with the system such as users of a video streaming system and items, which is what a system offers such as videos in a video streaming service. Before graphs, user-item relationship was modeled using sparse matrices, where the user-item relationship was represented as a rating score. For instance, a user can give one to five star to a movie. The task of collaborative filtering was to use the known ratings, and predict ratings for unknown rarings.
